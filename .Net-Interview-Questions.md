## Technical Questions

### Question 1
**Q:** What is a linked list?  
**A:** .NET framework-based applications that are written in supportive languages like C#, F#, or Visual basic are compiled to Common Intermediate Language (CIL).
Compiled code is stored in the form of an assembly file that has a .dll or .exe file extension.
When the .NET application runs, Common Language Runtime (CLR) takes the assembly file and converts the CIL into machine code with the help of the Just In Time(JIT) compiler.
Now, this machine code can execute on the specific architecture of the computer it is running on.


### Question 2
**Q:** How does garbage collection work in Java?  
**A:** Garbage collection in Java is the process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically. The Java programs perform automatic garbage collection, so manual memory management is not needed.

## Behavioral Questions

### Question 1
**Q:** Describe a time you worked on a team project.  
**A:** [Provide your answer here]

### Question 2
**Q:** How do you handle tight deadlines?  
**A:** Absolutely! Let's dive into the `ref` keyword in .NET.

The `ref` keyword in C# is used to pass arguments by reference, which means you pass the memory address of the variable rather than its value. This allows the called method to modify the caller's variable directly.

### Usage

You use the `ref` keyword both in the method signature and when calling the method.

### In-Depth Details

- **Passing by Reference**: When you pass a parameter with the `ref` keyword, any changes made to the parameter inside the method will be reflected in that variable when control returns to the caller.
- **Initialization Requirement**: A variable passed to a method with `ref` must be initialized before it is passed.
- **Consistency**: The method definition and the method call must both use the `ref` keyword.

### Real-Time Example

Let's consider a simple scenario where you need to swap two numbers. Without using `ref`, you'd need to return the values and reassign them. With `ref`, you can directly swap the values.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;
        Console.WriteLine($"Before Swap: a = {a}, b = {b}");
        
        Swap(ref a, ref b);
        
        Console.WriteLine($"After Swap: a = {a}, b = {b}");
    }
    
    static void Swap(ref int x, ref int y)
    {
        int temp = x;
        x = y;
        y = temp;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: Here, `a` and `b` are initialized before passing to the `Swap` method.
- **Passing by Reference**: The `ref` keyword is used in both the method call `Swap(ref a, ref b)` and in the method definition `static void Swap(ref int x, ref int y)`.
- **Direct Modification**: The `Swap` method directly modifies the original values of `a` and `b`.

With `ref`, you get efficiency and flexibility, especially in cases where you need to modify multiple variables or large objects in a method.
